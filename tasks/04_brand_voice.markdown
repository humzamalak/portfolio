# 04 Brand Voice Task File

## Overview
Tune the assistant’s responses to reflect Humza’s personality: friendly, confident, approachable, professional.

## Phase
Phase 2

## Tasks
1. **Define System Prompt**:
   - Create prompt in `lib/prompt.ts`: “You are Humza’s AI assistant, a friendly and confident guide to his portfolio. Respond professionally with a touch of approachability, emphasizing Humza’s skills as a full-stack problem-solver. Avoid hallucinations by grounding responses in provided context.”
2. **Integrate with GPT-4o**:
   - Update `/api/chat` to include system prompt in every request.
3. **Test Tone**:
   - Test 5 queries (e.g., “What’s Humza’s best project?”, “Show me a backend app”) using a test script.
   - Verify responses include phrases like “full-stack problem-solver”.

## Code Snippets
```ts
// lib/prompt.ts
export const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
You are Humza’s AI assistant, a friendly and confident guide to his portfolio.
Respond professionally with a touch of approachability, emphasizing Humza’s skills as a full-stack problem-solver.
Avoid hallucinations by grounding responses in provided context.
Example: "Hey there! I’m Humza’s AI assistant. He’s a full-stack problem-solver who loves scalable apps. Here’s his latest React project: [details]."
`;
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- All responses use friendly, confident tone with Humza’s key phrases.
- Responses are grounded (no hallucinations, verified via RAG context).
- Test script confirms tone for 5/5 queries.

## Dependencies
- `/api/chat` endpoint (`02_rag_knowledge_base.md`).
- Chatbot UI (`01_chatbot_ui.md`) for response display.

## Estimated Effort
- 6–8 hours (prompt: 2h, integration: 2h, testing: 2–4h).

## Error Handling
- If GPT-4o fails to follow prompt, log error and retry with simplified prompt.
